# Filament Swatches
This is an iOS 16 app that lets you manage different materials, brands and colors of filament and write/read them to NFC tags.
The information is written as an URL with parameters and is intended to be used together with this static website: https://github.com/iComputerfreak/FilamentInfo.
You can provide your own custom base url in the settings of this app.

The idea behind this app was to store filament information on NFC tags which are put on filament samples.
